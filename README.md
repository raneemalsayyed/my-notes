## *good developer mindset*:

- ### The first and most important rule to follow to be a good developer is **code simplicity**

   -  a good developer should Think smartly how to write the code simply stupidly.
   -  how simple your code is for all to understand regarding their level of professionality, they should be able to change, work and add new features without having to write the code again from scratch because of the huge number of bugs or complexity.  
    - Code simplicity will make things easier for all people involved in the project, save a lot of time and at the end an efficient good work will be delivered.

- ### Developers should also:

    - Write a code they totally understand.
    - Develop and challenge themselves continuously and ask for help when needed.
    - Do Testing for the code as it is important in lowering the number of bugs that may appear while developing.
    - Do changes only when needed:
        - they should measure how much a change will affect the code, the effort needed, the results of this change and then actions should be taken.
